When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 
Mostly when collaborating and when I am working from more than one work place. Also to have back ups on remote servers.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - Cloning within Github
Clone - Get copy of repo from git hub to local
Branches - Used when code is branching away from master and can be merged again.
